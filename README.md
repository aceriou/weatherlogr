# weatherlogr
A weather logging system for Twitter.

# setup
You need to install python-tweepy, json, and urllib2.

```
sudo yum install python-pip
pip install tweepy
```

You can then edit rc.local file to run the init.py script, but that is only if you want the script to run on boot, otherwise just run the script in general.

You need to fill out the variables in the script to match your Twitter API keys, your Wunderground API keys, and your location you want to be logged.
